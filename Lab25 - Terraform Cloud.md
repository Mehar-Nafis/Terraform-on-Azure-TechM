### Task 2:Authorizing Terraform Cloud to write over Azure

#### Create an Azure Active Directory App Registration:
* Navigate to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.
* Search for "Azure Active Directory" and select "App registrations".
* Click "New registration".
* Give the app a name, select "Accounts in this organizational directory only", and click "Register".
#### Obtain Client ID, Tenant ID, and Subscription ID:
* After creating the app, navigate to "Overview".
* Copy the "Application (client) ID" (this is the client_id).
* Copy the "Directory (tenant) ID" (this is the tenant_id).
* Search for "Subscriptions" in the Azure portal.
* Select your subscription and copy the "Subscription ID".
#### Create a Client Secret:
* In the "App registrations" page, select your app.
* Go to "Certificates & secrets".
* Click "New client secret".
* Add a description and choose an expiry date.
* Click "Add".
* Copy the "Value" of the client secret (this is the client_secret). Remember to save this somewhere secure, as you won't be able to access it later.



### Task 3: Create a Terraform Cloud Account

* Create a Terraform Cloud Account and Login
```
https://app.terraform.io/app
```


### Task 4: Create a new workspace

* Create a new organization
* Click on create a new workspace
* In tab 1, Select VCS (Version Control System) 
* In tab 2, select Github
* Once you click Github.com, a new window will popup. Sign into your GitHub account from there. Perform the verification and install Terraform on Git. 
* Now, we have the GitHub account connected with Terraform cloud. In tab 3 choose the repository where Terraform configuration is present, in this case, its Terraform-Cloud.
* In tab 4, Provide the name for the workspace of  your own choice and click the Create Workspace button. Once the workspace is created, you will see a success message in a popup.
